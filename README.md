XDG::GuaranteedResources - Guarantees that a resource is present in the expected XDG Base Directory directory

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use XDG::GuaranteedResources;
# pass it the relative path to a file under your resources directory
# path must be listed in the resources array of your META6.json
guarantee-resource("config/app_config.toml");

# if you have multiple to guarantee you can call
guarantee-resources(<config/app_config.toml data/cool_database.db>);
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Many tools expect a config file, sqlite database, or similar to be present. We store these in the resources listed in `META6.json`, and need to test if they exist and copy them over from `resources` if not.

`XDG::GuaranteedResources` handles this common operation.

For example:

Let's assume your script uses a pre-prepared sqlite db that you store under resources. Store it under `resources/data/my_database.db`, then when your script boots up you can call `guarantee-resource("data/my_database.db");`. If that file already exists under `%*ENV<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/my_database.db` nothing will happen. If it isn't found there, a fresh copy will be placed there from the one you referenced in `resources`.

Resources that should be copied to `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` should be stored under `resources/config`

Resources that should be copied to `XDG_DATA_HOME` should be stored under `resources/data`

Subdirectories are fine. E.g. `resources/data/subdir/my_db.db`

âš  Currently only works on Unix (Linux, BSD, macOS, etc.) systems.
